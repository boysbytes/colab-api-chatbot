# Google Colab Chatbots

> How can I lower the floor so young learners can experience, understand, and experiment with LLMs?

These are chatbots I built on Google Colaboratory. I wanted a way for young learners to not only use generative AI but to also see the frameworks used.

This chatbot implementation uses the Google Gemini API. I see the potential for learners to use this as their personal (and personalized) chatbot that they can use to bounce ideas while they are learning a topic.

Unfortunately, the model is proprietary and there are API usage limits.
